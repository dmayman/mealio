# Weekly Meal Planning App ‚Äì PRD

## Overview
A meal planning tool for individuals and families to easily manage their weekly food needs‚Äîfrom deciding what to eat, to buying groceries, to cooking meals. The app reduces the cognitive load of grocery shopping and meal planning, helping people feel more in control of what they eat without being overwhelmed.

This is a mobile-first product, but should be web accessible too.

## Problem Statement
Buying food and cooking regularly is a burden. Many people want to be healthy and plan meals but fall behind due to lack of tools to organize recipes, plan meals around their schedule, and shop efficiently. This leads to decision fatigue, wasted groceries, and last-minute takeout.

## Users
- Adults or families who cook at home 3+ times a week and want to eat healthier or reduce friction around food.
